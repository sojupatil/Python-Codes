 ## [1 - Simple Comparator](https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name/blob/main/project1.py)
 
Overview

This project compares stock prices using lists, tuples, and dictionaries. It takes user input for stock names and prices, then determines which stock has a higher price using if-else conditions.

Concepts Covered:

Lists (list) → Stores stock names and prices in an ordered sequence.

Tuples (tuple) → Stores stock data in an immutable format.

Dictionaries (dict) → Uses key-value pairs for structured data storage.

If-Else Statements → Compares stock prices and prints the result.


More projects coming soon.

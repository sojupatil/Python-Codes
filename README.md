# 100 Mini Codes - Python 

*I'm Still learning*

About This Repository

This repository contains 100 mini codes focused on Python programming. Each Code covers different topics, demonstrating practical implementations of Python concepts.

 ## [1 - Simple Comparator](https://github.com/sojupatil/Python-Mini-Projects/blob/main/SimpleComparator.py)
 
### Overview

This Code compares stock prices using lists, tuples, and dictionaries. It takes user input for stock names and prices, then determines which stock has a higher price using if-else conditions.

### Concepts:

**Lists (list)** → Stores stock names and prices in an ordered sequence.

**Tuples (tuple)** → Stores stock data in an immutable format.

**Dictionaries (dict)** → Uses key-value pairs for structured data storage.

**If-Else Statements** → Compares stock prices and prints the result.

 ## [1 - Temperature Scale Converter](https://github.com/sojupatil/Python-Mini-Projects/blob/main/SimpleComparator.py)
 
### Overview

This Code takes Celsius as Input from user and convert it into Fahrenheit and vice vera
### Concepts:
Simple Arthmetic operations.

More coming soon.
